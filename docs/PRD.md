# My Hackathon Signup - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
My Hackathon Signup is a web-based platform designed to streamline the management of company hackathons, enabling efficient team formation, project submission, and judging processes. The platform aims to foster innovation and collaboration while reducing administrative overhead.

### Target Audience
- Company employees (participants)
- Hackathon organizers
- Judges
- Company leadership (observers)

### Key Value Propositions
- Simplifies hackathon management and administration
- Streamlines team formation and project submissions
- Provides transparent judging and evaluation
- Creates a historical record of hackathon projects
- Encourages cross-departmental collaboration

### Success Metrics
- 90% of eligible employees register on the platform
- 85% team formation rate prior to hackathon
- 95% project submission rate
- Positive user satisfaction scores (>4.0/5.0)
- Reduction in administrative overhead by 50%

### Timeline Overview
- Phase 1 (4 weeks): Authentication, user registration, and team formation
- Phase 2 (3 weeks): Project submission and management
- Phase 3 (3 weeks): Judging system and results display
- Phase 4 (2 weeks): Testing, refinement, and launch

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- Manual hackathon registration processes are time-consuming
- Team formation is often disorganized and lacks transparency
- Project submissions are inconsistent in format and content
- Judging processes lack standardization
- Results compilation is manual and error-prone
- Historical hackathon data is not centrally stored

### Market Opportunity
While specific to internal company use, this platform addresses a common need across tech organizations to better manage innovation initiatives. A successful implementation could potentially be expanded to:
- Multiple company locations
- Industry hackathons
- Educational institutions
- External innovation challenges

### User Needs
Based on feedback from previous hackathons:
- Participants need easy registration and team discovery
- Teams need clear project submission guidelines
- Judges need consistent evaluation frameworks
- Organizers need administrative dashboards
- Observers need visibility into projects and results

### Business Impact
- Increase employee participation in innovation initiatives
- Improve quality of hackathon outputs
- Identify promising projects for further development
- Foster cross-departmental collaboration
- Build culture of innovation

### Competitive Analysis
Internal solutions:
- Current process uses a combination of Google Forms, Slack, and email
- No integrated solution exists

External alternatives:
- Devpost (focuses on public hackathons)
- HackerEarth (enterprise solution with many features beyond our needs)
- Custom Slack integrations (limited functionality)
